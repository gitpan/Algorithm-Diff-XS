NAME
    Algorithm::Diff::XS - Algorithm::Diff with XS core loop

SYNOPSIS
        # Drop-in replacement to Algorithm::Diff, but ~50x faster
        use Algorithm::Diff::XS qw( ... );
        Algorithm::Diff::XS->new( ... );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple re-packaging of Joe Schaefer's excellent but not
    very well-known Algorithm::LCS with a drop-in interface that simply
    re-uses the Algorithm::Diff module.

SEE ALSO
    Algorithm::Diff, Algorithm::LCS.
